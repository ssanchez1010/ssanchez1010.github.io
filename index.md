## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, part 1

    This lab was fun because it helped me gain more understanding about defining variables. In this lab we had to program a code that converted an inputted amount of mL to tsp to tbsp to oz and lastly to cups. There were a lot of different variables that had to be kept track of, so it was challenging at times, but when we were finally able to get the converser to work, it felt very rewarding.

* Lab 4, part 2

    This lab was one of my favorites because we basically made our own little game. In this lap we used if loops to test whether or not player two guessed player one's\\\ number. It was overall a very simple but fun lab that helped us build a better understanding of how to use if loops. Plus if loops are probably one of, if not, my favorite loops!

* Lab 6, part 1

    This lab was my favorite lab because it was fun, simple, and silly. In this lab we used a vector to input the protein, bread, and condiment of a sandwich. It was a really good introduction to vectors, and the overall lab was very simple to tackle. Because it was simple it made understanding vectors much easier.
